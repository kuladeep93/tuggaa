                                What makes Tuggaa so special? It starts with our diverse and talented staff of planners, project managers, account professionals, designers, producers, strategists, technologists, finance managers and more. This team is focused on customer success and willing to work together to ensure we deliver that success every time.
                                <br><br>
                                Every event is developed based on extensive customer research, guided and enriched by industry partners, informed by local market expertise, and supported by the world’s largest global exhibition network.
                                <br><br>
                                Working as a team doesn’t just happen; we hire for it, train for it, mentor it and have developed a methodology that keeps everyone moving toward the same goal: Customer Success. That only works when we share the same values, and at Tuggaa, that means integrity—personal integrity, team integrity, and integrity in the work we deliver.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                That’s the Tuggaa difference and we call the formula Team.
                                <br><br>
                                Tuggaa events deliver more: more opportunities to do business, to see and be seen, to listen and learn, and to connect with the people that count.

                                <p>Not only do exhibitions generate more sales leads than any other sales tool apart from companies’ own websites*, they also close sales effectively, help maximise your future pipeline and speed up the sales process. Even in the Internet age, when information is easier to come by, you’re more likely to secure a deal face-to-face at an exhibition.</p>

                                <p>And when times are tough, exhibitions work harder for your marketing budget than any other media. Only at an exhibition can you generate direct sales while simultaneously enhancing your brand image, launching new products, researching your market, building your prospect databases AND maintaining relationships with your existing customers.</p>
