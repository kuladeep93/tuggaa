            <strong>Valuing our people</strong>
            <br>
            We put the highest priority on recruiting, developing and retaining outstanding people. Our managers are directly responsible for the development of their people and we recognise and reward achievement. Whatâ€™s more, we enjoy what we do and celebrate success. Our people are empowered to maximise their potential and contribution. Above all, we respect our people, encourage open and honest communication and behave in an ethical and principled manner.

We always execute well and deliver on our intentions. We set aggressive goals and strive to beat them, and we hold ourselves and each other accountable for outstanding results.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Innovation</strong><br>
            We welcome and push change; we challenge the status quo. We encourage our people to be entrepreneurial, take some risks and learn from mistakes. We are ready to make bold moves and decisions. We constantly look for new ideas, and value 'out-of-the-box' thinking. We keep things simple and minimise bureaucracy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Boundarylessness</strong><br>
            We welcome the global nature of our business and encourage people to work collaboratively across business units, hierarchy and functions. We constantly strive to break down barriers between organisations and we seek partnerships with customers and suppliers.
